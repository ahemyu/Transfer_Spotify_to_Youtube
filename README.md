# Transfer_Spotify_to_Youtube
Simple script to transfer playlists from spotify to youtube music (as youtube music is actually worth it's money). 
## Setup
- one needs a google cloud app set up with the Youtube Data V3 API enabled and download the client secret in the same directory as this script
- you also need to set up a spotify app where you only need the client id and secret
- you need to know the ids for the spotify playlists you want to transfer (it's the last part of the url), and either a youtube music playlist id or a name for the name playlist.
